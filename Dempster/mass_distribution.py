"""
The structure of a discrete mass distribution is a list of tupples where each tuple 
is a prop-mass-pair. HOWEVER, some definitions first.

DISCRETE PROPOSITION:  a python string, e.g., 'a'  is a proposition, 'hot' is another 
      example of a proposition, 'cold' is another example, 'cc' is yet another example. 
      
SET OF DISJOINT AND MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE DISCRETE PROPOSITIONS:  a set of one or more DISCRETE 
      PROPOSITIONS. For example,  {'a'} is a set of one disjoint and mutually exclusive 
      propositions.  {'hot', 'b'} is another example of a set of disjoint and mutually 
      exclusive propositions, and {'cold', 'hot', 'cc'} is yet another example of a set of 
      disjoint and mutually exclusive propositions.  

A MASS VALUE: a floating point number > 0 and <= 1.  For example, 0.5 is a mass value, 0.254 is 
        another mass value, ...etc. 
        
PROP MASS PAIR:  a tuple of a set of disjoint and mutually exclusive propositions and a 
      mass value. For example, ({'hot', 'b'}, 0.5) is an example of a PROP MASS PAIR. 
      ({'a', 'b', 'c'}, 0.334) is another example of a PROP MASS PAIR. 
      
MASS DISTRIBUTION: a Python list consisting of one or more PROP MASS PAIRs such that the sum of the mass associated with
    each PROP MASS PAIR  sums to 1.0.  For example [ ({'a', 'b', 'c'}, 0.334), ({'hot', 'b'}, 0.5), 
    ({'cold', 'medium'}, 0.166) ]  

TRUE PROPOSITION: a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive propositions that represents
     all possible outcomes/observations assiated with a random variable called a frame (within
     the context of belief functions and evidential reasoning. For example, {'a', 'b', 'c'} is 
     an example of a true proposition.
