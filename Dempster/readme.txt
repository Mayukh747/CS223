My driver_mass_distribution.py file invokes the plot_dempster_perf() function.

It will invoke my recursive implementation of dempster's rule with different input sizes
before plotting the duration on a lineplot.

Nothing special outside of running the main function required.

Short sentences provided under each function as documentation.
